        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>New widgets and controls are emerging, driven by the flexibility of the web</li>
                <li>...but this is happening on desktop, too!</li>
                <li>Often these new widgets are hybrids: they blend functionality from one widget with another</li>
                <li>Assistive Technology APIs have no extension mechanism, currently</li>
                <li>Screen readers, in particular, rely entirely on the name: there's no equivalence of an affordance</li>
                <li>End result? Design innovation becomes a barrier to user experience: hard to learn new interactions</li>
            </ul>
